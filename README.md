## Introduction

This project is a web application designed for DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack detection using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. The application predicts whether a network activity represents a DDoS attack based on various features provided as input.

## Features

- Predicts DDoS attacks based on input features such as duration, service type, source bytes, destination bytes, etc.
- User-friendly interface for entering input data and viewing prediction results.
- Scalable architecture allowing for easy integration with other systems.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap

## Usage

To use the DDoS Attack Detection website, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask web server using `python app.py`.
4. Access the website in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to a production environment, follow these steps:

1. Set up a web server capable of running Flask applications.
2. Configure the server environment and install required dependencies.
3. Upload the project files to the server.
4. Configure the server to run the Flask application as a WSGI application.
5. Set up any necessary firewall rules or security measures.
